# cs203-S2019-conduct

This repository contains the conduct guide for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/). The instructor
and students will use this conduct guide to govern all course interactions.

## The Conduct Guide

As a team, we developed a Conduct Guide to which we all have agreed to adhere.
Our Conduct Guide is based on direct instruction from the instructor, as well as
inspiration taken from sources such as [Codes of Values from MIT's Course on
Product Engineering
Processes](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/codeOfEthics/codeOfEthics.html).
The Conduct Guide is divided into 9 unique sections:
 * Attendance
 * Deadlines
 * Communication
 * Participation
 * Conduct
 * Decisions
 * Postmortems
 * Conflicts
 * Infractions

The details for each section can be found in the `conduct.md` document
[here](conduct.md). Every student in this course has agreed to adhere to the
Conduct Guide via digital signature at the end of the `conduct.md` document.

## Problems with the Conduct Guide
