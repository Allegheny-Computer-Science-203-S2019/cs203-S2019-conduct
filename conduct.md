## Deadlines

To determine appropriate deadlines conduct policies it is first important to
break up deadlines into the different types of possible deadlines for the
course. The deadlines categories that are possible are those when working
directly with group members to finish work necessary to move onto other parts
of the lab, along with completing your assigned portion of the work by the due
date of the lab.

* **Acceptable Behavior (C)**

* Talk with team members and discuss work needed to be done.

* Set up a reasonable time frame for when the work should be completed
  leaving time for the rest of the lab.

* Take into consideration other people's schedules and activities as it may
  not align with yours.

* If you can not come up with an agreed upon time frame, have a vote
  between teammates that are present to determine the time frame.

* If problems still arise then seek out other team members.

* Grade yourself based on the grading scale given to determine how well you
  followed the deadlines section. Grading scale is as follows,

* All software project assignments completed have a specified due date, whereas
  the electronic copy must be uploaded to GitHub through the designated repository
  before the assigned deadline.

* Software projects will be completed according to the deadline set by
  the students, and within the one week period before the next laboratory session
  begins.

* **Unacceptable Behavior (U)**

* Not discussing things with team members on due dates.

* Not completing work on time.

* Not participating in votes on material.

* Not communicating reasons for work being late and not on time.

* If work is submitted after the specified deadline, the assignment will not be
  accepted and no credit will be given (unless specified otherwise). All submitted
  software project assignments must contain high-quality, well documented code.
