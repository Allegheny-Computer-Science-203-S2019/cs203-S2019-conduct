##Conduct

In this context, we will be defining conduct as the way a team member behaves
and the way they act when carrying out their part of the project. First, everyone
is obligated to adhere to the 9 categories in the Code of Conduct. They will be
our foundation throughout the semester when working together. Moving on, everyone
should respect one another; no one should be excluded based off of race or gender.
Team members should not shun the ideas of anyone, especially those who may
have not have had an equal amount of experience as others. Also, at the beginning
of each session, everyone should enter with positive attitudes, These positive
attitudes should stay consistent whether the project is working or breaking.

* **Acceptable Conduct (A):**
  * Respect to all peers
  * Allowing all members to voice their opinion
  * Showing positive attitudes towards all aspects of the project

* **Unacceptable Conduct (U):**
  * Excluding members of team based off of their race or gender
  * Refusal to follow the rest of the categories in the Code of Conduct
  * Showing a negative attitude towards group members or aspects of the project
