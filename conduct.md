## Participation

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. Participation
gives room for exchange of ideas that people can work on and implement as a group.
In order to achieve the goals for the group, it is the sole responsibility of each
and every team member to be involved in the work going on. The more we put into our
efforts, the better will be the outcome. Nevertheless, this can be an amazing
opportunity to know your team members.
