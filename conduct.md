## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all Labs on time. If you and
your team deem it possible, team members may leave the lab, so long as they
are available via `Slack` for the allotted lab times. This would be considered
working remotely, and requires the consent of the other team members or
approval from the instructor. For further guidance on attendance in `Labs` and
`Class` please refer to the [course
website](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/), contact the
[instructor](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/contact/), or schedule an
[appointment](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/).
