## Participation

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work.
Participation gives room for exchange of ideas that people can work on and
implement as a group. In order to achieve the goals for the group, it is the
sole responsibility of every team member to be involved in the work going on.
The more we put into our efforts, the better will be the outcome. This can be
an amazing opportunity to bond well with the team members and bring positivity
that will bring long-term benefits for the team.

## Decision

Decisions should be made in the environment that every team member's opinion
is considered important. They should be made collectively as a team or at
least 80% of the majority's consensus. All information needed to make a
decision will be clearly stated to every team member and all concerns should
be clearly expressed. We will use data, rational knowledge and specific
experience to make decisions instead of popular opinion. Team members need to
objectively analyzed the options for the best of the team. Trust and respect
the decision made in order to move on the project.

* **Unacceptable (U):**
