Decisions should be made in the environment that every team member's opinion
is considered important. They should be made collectively as a team or at
least 80% of the majority's consensus. All information needed to make a
decision will be clearly stated to every team member and all concerns should
be clearly expressed. We will use data, rational knowledge and specific
experience to make decisions instead of popular opinion. Team members need to
objectively analyzed the options for the best of the team. Trust and respect
the decision made in order to move on the project.
