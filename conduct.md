## Participation

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work.
Participation gives room for exchange of ideas that people can work on and
implement as a group. In order to achieve the goals for the group, it is the
sole responsibility of every team member to be involved in the work going on.
The more we put into our efforts, the better will be the outcome. This can be
an amazing opportunity to bond well with the team members and bring positivity
that will bring long-term benefits for the team.

* **Acceptable Participation (C):**
  * Participating in Slack discussions
  * Being open to meeting outside of class time
  * Asking questions
  * Sharing one's views without triggering someone else's
  * Enabling discussions in a polite and pleasant form
  * Disagreeing in a polite manner if required

* **Unacceptable Participation (U):**
  * Not participating in Slack Polls
  * Missing lab sections without consent of the course instructor

  * Interrupting a team member with criticism without offering him/her the
    opportunity to share their views
  * Passing offensive comments during discussions
  * Trying to dominate a discussion
  * Talking about topics entirely irrelevant to the discussions

## Decision

Decisions should be made in the environment that every team member's opinion
is considered important. They should be made collectively as a team or at
least 80% of the majority's consensus. All information needed to make a
decision will be clearly stated to every team member and all concerns should
be clearly expressed. We will use data, rational knowledge and specific
experience to make decisions instead of popular opinion. Team members need to
objectively analyzed the options for the best of the team. Trust and respect
the decision made in order to move on the project.

* **Unacceptable (U):**
  * Making decisions without notifying team members.
  * Question the decision after it is made.
  * Making a decision based on only popular opinion.

## Infractions

An ***infraction*** shall hereby be defined as a penalty given as a result of a
violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide by any individual who has agreed
to adhere to the Conduct Guide via digital signature below. The infractions for
any individual shall be recorded and managed by the instructor.

A *violation* of the Conduct Guide is defined as any behavior that results in receiving
a "U" (Unacceptable) for any of the above outlined (sub)sections.

Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:

* **Level I**: A ***Level I infraction*** is defined as a formally documented
 violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide. A Level I infraction may be
 suggested to the instructor by a team or project leader for any given project.
 All Level I infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level II**: A ***Level II infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated three Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level II infraction,
 the individual will no longer be eligible to receive a check for the week. All
 Level II infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level III**: A ***Level III infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
 the individual will be docked 10% of their grade for the current project. All
 Level III infractions will be reset after the completion of the current project.

If an individual commits multiple violations of the Conduct Guide, a team or
project leader may suggest a proportional amount of Level I infractions for the
violations to the instructor, provided there is proper citation to the Conduct
Guide for the violations. While a team or project leader may suggest any number
of infractions, an individual *should* not incur more than **three** infractions
for a single instance of violations. The number of Level I infractions imposed
upon the individual shall ultimately be determined by the instructor.

An individual who has received any number of infractions may appeal said
infraction(s) directly to the instructor of the course. Any decision received
from the instructor for being given the infraction(s) will be final.
