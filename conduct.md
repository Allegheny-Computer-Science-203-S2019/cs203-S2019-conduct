## Categories of Conduct

* Attendance
* Deadlines

To determine appropriate deadlines conduct policies it is first important to break up deadlines into the different types of possible deadlines for the course. The deadlines categories that are possible are those when working directly with group members to finish work necessary to move onto other parts of the lab, along with completing your assigned portion of the work by the due date of the lab.

Work needed to complete to move on

When working with team members to complete a specific part of the lab needed to move on in the lab, some steps need to be taken and are as follows.

1. Talk with team members and discuss work needed to be done.
2. Set up a reasonable time frame for when the work should be completed leaving time for the rest of the lab.
3. Take into consideration other people's schedules and activities as it may not align with yours.
4. If you can not come up with an agreed upon time frame, have a vote between teammates that are present to determine the time frame.
5.  If problems still arise then seek out other team members.
6. Grade yourself based on the grading scale given to determine how well you followed the deadlines section. Grading scale is as follows,

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

Work for the completion of the lab

All software project assignments completed have a specified due date, whereas the electronic copy
must be uploaded to GitHub through the designated repository before the assigned deadline. Software
projects will be completed according to the deadline set by the students, and within the one week
period before the next laboratory session begins. If work is submitted after the specified
deadline, the assignment will not be accepted and no credit will be given (unless specified
otherwise). All submitted software project assignments must contain high-quality, well documented
code.
