## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all Labs on time. If you and
your team deem it possible, team members may leave the lab, so long as they
are available via `Slack` for the allotted lab times. This would be considered
working remotely, and requires the consent of the other team members or
approval from the instructor. For further guidance on attendance in `Labs` and
`Class` please refer to the [course
website](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/), contact the
[instructor](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/contact/), or schedule an
[appointment](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/).

## Decision

Decisions should be made in the environment that every team member's opinion
is considered important. They should be made collectively as a team or at
least 80% of the majority's consensus. All information needed to make a
decision will be clearly stated to every team member and all concerns should
be clearly expressed. We will use data, rational knowledge and specific
experience to make decisions instead of popular opinion. Team members need to
objectively analyzed the options for the best of the team. Trust and respect
the decision made in order to move on the project.

* **Unacceptable (U):**
  * Making decisions without notifying team members.
  * Question the decision after it is made.
  * Making a decision based on only popular opinion.
